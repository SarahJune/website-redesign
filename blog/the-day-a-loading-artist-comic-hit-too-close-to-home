      <h2 class="blog-header">The day a Loading Artist comic hit too close to home</h2>
      <p class="offset_1">I’m experiencing two very different emotions as I sit down to write this blog post.</p>
      <p class="offset_1">1. Embarrassment that it has been OVER A YEAR since I wrote my last blog post (correction: published my last blog post. I definitely have two or three drafts that will never see the light of day. Ever.)</p>
      <p class="offset_1">2. Surprise at how much has changed (new job, new haircut,* and new apartment)</p>
      <p class="offset_1">I had been putting off blogging again because I really want to redesign my website. In February of this year I joined the stellar team at a startup called Code Fellows here in Seattle, and have taken an <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/courses/foundations-1/computer-science-and-web-development" target="_blankt">introductory programming course on computer science and web development</a> (<- shameless plug. I am on their marketing team, after all). I already knew some HTML and CSS, and learned a bit of JavaScript as well, plus I’ve been going through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript"target="_blank">Codecademy’s JavaScript tutorials</a>. Working in a startup that teaches people how to code is the perfect opportunity to learn some web development (just enough to make me dangerous), although when I told one of the instructors I wanted to redo my website from scratch on my own (haha, I was so innocent in those days), he responded, “Wow, that’s…ambitious.” Now I think I understand why.</p>
      <p class="offset_1">I’ll revamp the site once I decide on a design and get up the guts and time to actually start on it. Until then, I’m getting much better at HTML, learning CSS, and hoping that if I do enough online tutorials, JavaScript will start to make sense.</p>
      <p class="offset_1">For now, I’m going to stop allowing myself to use the excuse, “I’ll start blogging when I redo my website.” Today is the day! (Also <a href="http://www.loadingartist.com/comic/now-and-never/" target="_blank">today’s Loading Artist comic</a> may have acted as a catalyst to get me writing again.) My goal is one blog post a week, but I’ll settle for two or three a month. It may be a while before I’m confident enough to actually share them on Facebook (oh my gosh my friends would see it!).</p>
      <p class="offset_1">Also, when I first launched this site, it was supposed to serve as an online portfolio/resume after I graduated from university. But now, 18 months later, I think I’d rather it be a hodgepodge mix of life, work, humor, and new ideas—a reflection of my personality (instead of that dreary professional-only focus it had before. Bleh). Maybe if I just start writing, the blog will eventually find its focus. And, bonus, I’ll get some solid writing and editing experience. Win-win! </p>
      <p class="offset_1"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I’m writing again (obvi) and have plans for a new website in the future (fingers crossed). Also, my blog post topics are about to get a lot more interesting.**</p>
      <p class="offset_1"><em>*I don’t look like the girl in this photo anymore! I may not change the picture until this blog is something I’m marginally proud of. Disguise and all that.<em></p>
      <p class="offset_1"><em>**It was pretty boring before (tell me the truth, I can take it), so the way I see it, there’s only up from here.<em></p>
